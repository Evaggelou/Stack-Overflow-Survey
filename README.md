# Stack-Overflow-Survey

## Project Motivation:
I was interested in understanding what Stack Overflow survey result can tell us about gender diversity, job satisfaction and if programming becoming less demanding with more experience, so I tried to answer the following questions from the available dataset:

- How many of them were Men, Women, and other genders? Are the Men and Women equally satisfied with their jobs?
- Does the programming become less challenging with the years of experience?
- Is the salary an important indicator for the satisfaction of the employers in the community of programming?

## What is included?

The dataset used has 2 parts/files:
- survey-results-schema.csv file: contains code book for columns in "survey-results-public.csv" file, it shows detailed description of the question asked.
- survey-results-public.csv: contains actual survey result

The code that has been used is available at the jupyter notebook with title: "Stack_Overflow_Survey.ipynb" and it is also available at google colab.

## Installation
Since the dataset was too large to be uploaded directly on Github, the dataset can be found [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey)
The code can easily at the colab notebook without any extra installation or locally just with the anaconda distribution. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/p/5d105aed1856/edit)

## Acknowledgements
I must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data.
